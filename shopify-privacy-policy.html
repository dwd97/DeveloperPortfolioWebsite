  <h1>AI Product Copywriter – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <small>Last updated: <time datetime="2025-08-13">August 13, 2025</time></small>

<main>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>FlowCart Apps</strong> (“<strong>we</strong>”,
    “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>”) collects, uses, and shares information when you
    install or use the <strong>AI Product Copywriter</strong> app (the “<strong>App</strong>”) with your online store.
    By installing or using the App, you agree to this Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>1) What this policy covers</h2>
  <p>This Policy applies to merchants who install the App and, where applicable, to their store visitors and customers whose data may be processed through the merchant’s store. We act as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Processor</strong> for personal data we handle on behalf of merchants (e.g., product or order metadata used by the App).</li>
    <li><strong>Controller</strong> for account, billing, or support information we collect about merchants directly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Information we collect</h2>
  <div class="box">
    <p><strong>From Shopify (on install/use):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Store details: store ID, domain, name, email, plan, locale, time zone.</li>
      <li>Scopes and access tokens necessary to run the App.</li>
      <li>Store data the App works with (e.g., products, collections; optionally orders/customers if you enable related features).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>From merchants directly:</strong> contact info (name, email), support messages, billing info (via our payment provider).</p>
    <p><strong>Automatically:</strong> usage logs, device/browser info, IP address, and diagnostics (to maintain security and improve reliability).</p>
    <p><strong>End customer data:</strong> only to the extent provided by the merchant’s store and required for App functionality. We do not contact end customers.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>3) How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide, configure, and maintain the App’s features.</li>
    <li>To authenticate the App with your store and Shopify APIs.</li>
    <li>To respond to support requests and communicate about the Service.</li>
    <li>To monitor performance, troubleshoot, prevent fraud/abuse, and meet legal obligations.</li>
    <li>For optional analytics to understand feature usage (aggregated where possible).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Legal bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Performance of a contract</em> (providing the App).</li>
    <li><em>Legitimate interests</em> (security, improvement, analytics in a proportionate manner).</li>
    <li><em>Consent</em> where required (e.g., certain cookies or marketing).</li>
    <li><em>Legal obligation</em> (tax, accounting, compliance).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Sharing and disclosure</h2>
  <p>We share data only as needed to run the App or as required by law:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Shopify</strong> – to integrate with your store and comply with platform requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>Hosting & infrastructure</strong> – e.g., application hosting, databases, logging, and monitoring providers.</li>
    <li><strong>Support & communications</strong> – ticketing/email tools.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment processing</strong> – if applicable for paid plans.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal</strong> – to comply with lawful requests or enforce our terms.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell personal data.</p>

  <h2>6) International transfers</h2>
  <p>
    We may process and store information in countries other than your own. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses) for cross-border transfers.
  </p>

  <h2>7) Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    We keep merchant account and App activity data for as long as your subscription is active and as needed for the purposes above. After uninstall, we remove or anonymize App-level store data within <strong>30 days</strong>, unless we must retain it for legal, accounting, or security reasons. You can request earlier deletion (see “Your rights”).
  </p>

  <h2>8) Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect personal data (access controls, encryption in transit, least-privilege access, and monitoring). No method of transmission or storage is fully secure.
  </p>

  <h2>9) Your rights</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, export, object to, or delete personal data. Merchants can contact us using the details below. If you are an end customer of a merchant’s store, please contact the merchant first; we will support the merchant’s request as required.
  </p>

  <h2>10) Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
  <p>
    The App may use essential cookies (for authentication/session) and limited analytics. Where required, we will request consent for non-essential cookies.
  </p>

  <h2>11) Uninstalling the App</h2>
  <p>
    You can uninstall the App from your store’s admin. We receive a platform webhook and begin the data deletion process described in “Data retention.”
  </p>

  <h2>12) Children</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to individuals under 16, and we do not knowingly collect their data.</p>

  <h2>13) Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted here with a new “Last updated” date.
